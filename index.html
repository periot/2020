<p>The  Internet-of-Things (IoT) is a  novel  paradigm  that  is  rapidly  gaining  ground  in  the  scenario  of  modern  wireless   telecommunications.   The   IoT   enables   large   numbers   of   previously   unconnected   devices   to  communicate  and  exchange  data  and  deal  with  services  that  span  areas  from  healthcare  to  transportation  and  much  more,  with  the  potential  for  significant  benefits  to  people  and  quality  of  life.  In  recent  years,  the  Internet  has  become  increasingly  pervasive  allowing  people  to  connect  anytime  and  everywhere  to  achieve  pervasiveness  and  mobility.  The  coupling  among  mobile  technology,  embedded  objects,  and  a  worldwide   pervasive   communication   infrastructure   constitutes   the   Mobile   and   Pervasive   Internet-of-Things.  However,  the  domain  of  mobile  and  pervasive  IoT  has  expanded  in  recent  years  which  gave  rise  to  few  new  challenges  like  1)  IoT  has  quickly  evolved  to  a  new  appified  era  where  third-party  developers  can   write  apps  for  IoT  platforms   using  programming  frameworks,  2)   with   the   advent   of   emerging   IoT  technologies  like  industrial  IoT,  agriculture  IoT  and  narrowband  IoT,  new  research  problems  are  surfacing  related  to  connectivity  and  data  storage,  and  3)  the  confluence  of  IoT  with  augmented  and  virtual  reality  (AR/VR),  there  are  newer  challenges  to  enable  digital  representation  of  physical  objects.  The  solution  to  these  new  challenges  will  enable  a  detailed  characterization  of  the  real  physical  applications,  as  well  as  a  rich  set  of  pervasive  interactions  with  the  physical  world.    </p>
<p>With  the  widespread  adoption  of  emerging  IoT  technologies,  it  has  the  potential  at  merging  the  physical  and  digital  world,  not  in  a  way  where  we  can  just  see  things,  but  one  where  we  can  give  digital  objects  physical   characteristics.   In   coming   years,   pervasive   computing,   together   with   newer   emerging   IoT  technologies,  has  the  potential  to  revolutionize  future  pervasive  applications  and  influence  the  real-world  entities  to  achieve  a  better  quality  of  life  for  the  future  generation  of  human.  Hence,  we  aim  to  focus  on  general   research   problems   arising   from   the   pervasive   interaction   and   communication   of   emerging   IoT  technologies  in  the  physical  world  and  in  the  virtual  world.  Some  of  these  research  challenges  may  include  issues  related  to  conflicting  standards,  multiple  vendor  interfaces,  suitable  networks  protocols,  bandwidth  scarcity,  data  analytics,  content  organization,  vulnerability  of  existing  open  source  protocols,  verification  and  testing,  energy  efficiency,  user  experience,  and  etc.  Finally,  this  workshop  solicits  high-quality  papers  presenting  original  research  results  on  the  following  three  core  areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Existing  IoT  Technologies</strong>  (e.g.,  Appified  IoT  platforms)  </li>
<li><strong>Emerging  IoT  Technologies</strong>  (e.g.,  agriculture  IoT,  industrial  IoT,  narrowband  IoT,  IoT  Blockchain)  </li>
<li><strong>IoT  Protocols</strong>  (e.g.,  Zigbee,  Z-Wave,  MQTT,  CoAP)  </li>
</ol>
<p>Submissions  could  consist  of  theoretical  and  applied  research  in  topics  including,  but  not  limited  to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Design  of  new  protocols  for  existing  and  emerging  IoT  technologies  </li>
<li>Analysis  of  protocols  for  existing  and  emerging  IoT  technologies  </li>
<li>System  architectures  of  existing  and  emerging  IoT  systems  </li>
<li>Interoperability  of  existing  and  emerging  IoT  protocols    </li>
<li>Transition  from  research  prototype  to  industry  grade  products  </li>
<li>AI  and  Machine  Learning  for  existing  and  emerging  IoT  applications  </li>
<li>Testing,  Validation,  Verification  of  existing  and  emerging  IoT  protocols  </li>
<li>Energy  efficiency,  performance  and  optimization  in  existing  and  emerging  IoT  systems  </li>
<li>Vulnerability,  fault-tolerance,  and  reliability  in  existing  and  emerging  IoT  protocols  </li>
<li>Cloud  back-ends  and  resource  management  for  IoT  applications  </li>
<li>New   connectivity   methods   for   IoT   (e.g.   5G   Networks,   Legacy   Networks,   Software   Defined  Networks  for  IoT,  Named  IoT  Networking)  </li>
<li>IoT  application  for  augmented  and  virtual  reality  </li>
<li>New  protocols  for  pairing  AR/VR  with  existing  and  emerging  IoT  </li>
<li>Debugging  and  diagnosing  problems  in  IoT  protocols,  existing  and  emerging  IoT  technologies  </li>
<li>Experience  with  deployed  IoT  system  </li>
<li>Societal  impacts  of  the  existing  and  emerging  IoT  applications</li>
</ul>
<p>The   aim   of   this   workshop   is   to   bring   together   practitioners   and   researchers   from   both   academia   and  industry  in  order  to  have  a  forum  for  discussion  and  technical  presentations  on  the  recent  advances  in  the  area   of   existing   and   emerging   IoT   technologies.   It   furthermore   serves   as   a   forum   for   the   research  community  to  discuss  open  issues,  novel  solutions  and  the  future  development  of  emerging  IoT  based  solutions  for  pervasive  scenarios.  Hence,  we  invite  original  research  contributions  that  advance  the  state  of  the  art  as  well  as  position  papers  that  pose  a  new  direction  or  present  a  controversial  point  of  view.</p>
