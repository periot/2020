The IoT enables large numbers of previously unconnected devices to communicate and exchange data and deal with services that span areas from healthcare to transportation and much more, with the potential for significant benefits to people and quality of life. In recent years, the Internet has become increasingly pervasive allowing people to connect anytime and everywhere to achieve pervasiveness and mobility. The coupling among mobile technology, embedded objects, and a worldwide pervasive communication infrastructure constitutes the Mobile and Pervasive Internet-of-Things. However, the domain of mobile and pervasive IoT has expanded in recent years which gave rise to few new challenges like 1) IoT has quickly evolved to a new appified era where third-party developers can write apps for IoT platforms using programming frameworks, 2) with the advent of emerging IoT technologies like industrial IoT, agriculture IoT and narrowband IoT, new research problems are surfacing related to connectivity and data storage, and 3) the confluence of IoT with augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), there are newer challenges to enable digital representation of physical objects. The solution to these new challenges will enable a detailed characterization of the real physical applications, as well as a rich set of pervasive interactions with the physical world. With the widespread adoption of emerging IoT technologies, it has the potential at merging the physical and digital world, not in a way where we can just see things, but one where we can give digital objects physical characteristics. In coming years, pervasive computing, together with newer emerging IoT technologies, has the potential to revolutionize future pervasive applications and influence the real-world entities to achieve a better quality of life for the future generation of human. Hence, we aim to focus on general research problems arising from the pervasive interaction and communication of emerging IoT technologies in the physical world and in the virtual world. Some of these research challenges may include issues related to conflicting standards, multiple vendor interfaces, suitable networks protocols, bandwidth scarcity, data analytics, content organization, vulnerability of existing open source protocols, verification and testing, energy efficiency, user experience, and etc. Finally, this workshop solicits high-quality papers presenting original research results on the following three core areas: Existing IoT Technologies (e.g., Appified IoT platforms) Emerging IoT Technologies (e.g., agriculture IoT, industrial IoT, narrowband IoT, IoT Blockchain) IoT Protocols (e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave, MQTT, CoAP) Submissions could consist of theoretical and applied research in topics including, but not limited to: Design of new protocols for existing and emerging IoT technologies Analysis of protocols for existing and emerging IoT technologies System architectures of existing and emerging IoT systems Interoperability of existing and emerging IoT protocols Transition from research prototype to industry grade products AI and Machine Learning for existing and emerging IoT applications Testing, Validation, Verification of existing and emerging IoT protocols Energy efficiency, performance and optimization in existing and emerging IoT systems Vulnerability, fault-tolerance, and reliability in existing and emerging IoT protocols Cloud back-ends and resource management for IoT applications New connectivity methods for IoT (e.g. 5G Networks, Legacy Networks, Software Defined Networks for IoT, Named IoT Networking) IoT application for augmented and virtual reality New protocols for pairing AR/VR with existing and emerging IoT Debugging and diagnosing problems in IoT protocols, existing and emerging IoT technologies Experience with deployed IoT system Societal impacts of the existing and emerging IoT applications The aim of this workshop is to bring together practitioners and researchers from both academia and industry in order to have a forum for discussion and technical presentations on the recent advances in the area of existing and emerging IoT technologies. It furthermore serves as a forum for the research community to discuss open issues, novel solutions and the future development of emerging IoT based solutions for pervasive scenarios. Hence, we invite original research contributions that advance the state of the art as well as position papers that pose a new direction or present a controversial point of view.
